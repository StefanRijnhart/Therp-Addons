    "name": "Extended Search by Therp",
    "description": """This addon for the OpenERP web client allows for more
detailed search queries in any search view. It does so by adding an extra drop
down with all the fields of the model that point to related models (many2one,
one2many and many2many). When such a field is selected, a new subordinate search
view for that field's related model appears.

Multiple subordinate search views can be embedded that way either on the main
model or recursively. Combinations with advanced filters are possible. Queries
composed with subordinate search views can be saved as a custom filter.

This is a web addon for OpenERP 6.1
